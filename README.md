50 Days of Code Challenge is an initiative I am commiting to take, where I will be spending each day working on problem solving and personal projects to improve my skills and push my boundaries.

After one failed attempts, I'm coming back by publicly committing to the 50-DaysOfCode Challenge starting today!

I'm going to follow Two Main Rules:

  1]Code a minimum of an hour every day for the next 50 days.
  2]Tweet your progress every day with the #100DaysOfCode hashtag

My Exceptions:

  1]If I break the streak, I will make sure that I won't break it the next day
  2]My Community work, and few emergencies demands to take a day off

# Goals
